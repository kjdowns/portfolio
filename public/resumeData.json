    "bio":"I have been a language lover my entire life, and as a video game hobbyist I eventually discovered programming for myself. After years of casually self studying, I realized that computer languages weren't all that different from human ones. At the end of 2019, I decided to finally make the jump and enroll in Flatiron School's Full Stack Engineering program. Having graduated, I am now experienced in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and looking for new opportunities as a Junior Developer. I am Philadelphia based, but experienced and comfortable with remote work and always looking for new tools to add to my toolbox.",
